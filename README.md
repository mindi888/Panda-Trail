# Panda Trail

This is a game I created over winter break with a lot of help from this YouTube video => https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY9MnQ4x3zk, but I put my own twist to it.

The objective is as simple as can be, don't let the baby panda get distracted by the butterflies and yummy bamboo shoots! The panda needs to get back to his home!

To achieve this goal you must...
1. Jump over the bamboo shoots
2. Roll underneath the butterflies

P.S. This game will continue until you lose

Controls:
