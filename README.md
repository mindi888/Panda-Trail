# Panda-Trail
'''
This is a game I created over winter break with a lot of help from the this Youtube video => https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY9MnQ4x3zk
The objective is as simple as can be, don't let the baby panda get distracted by the butterflies and yummy bamboo shoots! The panda needs to get back to his home!
To achieve this goal you must...
1. Jump over the bamboo shoots
2. Roll underneath the butterflies

P.S. This game will continue on until you lose

Controls:
Press space to continue
Press the up arrow to jump
Hold down the down arrow to roll
